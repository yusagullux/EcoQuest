**Gamified Environmental Sustainability Platform**




## 📖 About

EcoQuest is a modern, gamified web application designed to raise awareness about environmental sustainability. Users complete eco-friendly missions, track their carbon footprint reduction, earn XP and EcoPoints, unlock badges, collect virtual plants, and compete on global leaderboards. By turning environmental actions into a game, EcoQuest makes sustainability engaging and rewarding.

### 🎯 Mission

Our mission is to inspire millions of people to adopt eco-friendly habits through gamification, making environmental consciousness a daily practice rather than an occasional thought.
